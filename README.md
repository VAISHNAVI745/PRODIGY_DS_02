🧪 Titanic Survival Analysis – Python Project This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to uncover survival patterns by analyzing relationships between variables like passenger class, age, fare, gender, and family size.

🔍 Objectives Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset using pandas

Performed detailed EDA to extract key insights

Explored survival trends across demographic and travel features

Built a single-page interactive dashboard using Plotly/Streamlit to present findings

📊 Dashboard Features Key Metrics: Survival Rate, Total Passengers, Survivors, Casualties, Average Fare, Average Age

Donut Chart: Overall survival breakdown

Bar Charts: Survival by Class, Gender, and Family Size

Histogram: Age distribution

Interactive filters: Gender and Class selection

Dark theme with Titanic-inspired styling for visual storytelling

🛠 Tools & Technologies pandas, numpy – Data cleaning and manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Data visualization

Streamlit – Interactive dashboard development

Titanic dataset (.csv from Kaggle)

📈 Key Insights 1st class and female passengers had significantly higher survival rates

Most passengers were from 3rd class

Solo travelers had lower chances of survival

Younger passengers had a higher survival probability
